# ds_vislavath_hathiram
This project explores the relationship between trader behavior and market sentiment using real-world datasets — the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index and Hyperliquid Trader Data. The goal is to understand how psychological sentiment (fear vs greed) affects trading activity, profitability, leverage, and risk-taking behavior.

Through data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we visualize trends in trader performance across different emotional market conditions. The project includes multiple statistical and probabilistic analyses, visual plots, and key insights that reveal how traders react during fear-dominant and greed-dominant periods.

The assignment follows a professional Data Science workflow:
- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Merging of Market Sentiment and Trader Data
- Descriptive Statistics and Probability Insights
- Visualization of Profitability, Risk, and Volume
- Correlation and Hypothesis Testing
- Summary Report and Visual Results

All analysis was performed in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy) using Jupyter/Colab notebooks.  
The final deliverables include the analysis notebook, datasets, output graphs, and a detailed PDF report.
